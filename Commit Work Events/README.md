## COMMIT/ROLLBACK Work Events

When a transaction is finished the data is either persisted or rolled back using the commands- COMMIT WORK ( & WAIT) or ROLLBACK WORK.

Many times we may need to react after the such commands- commit/rollback to do some other actions. But how to know if it is committed/rolled back?

The command COMMIT WORK ( & WAIT) or ROLLBACK WORK always triggers an event â€“ TRANSACTION_FINISHED of class CL_SYSTEM_TRANSACTION_STATE which exports a parameter KIND whose value is either C ( committed) / R ( rolled back). We can register for this event and react on it.
